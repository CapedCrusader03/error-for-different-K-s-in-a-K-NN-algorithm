# error-for-different-K-s-in-a-K-NN-algorithm
I've used K-NN algorithm for the prediction of the sales of a brand new car based on the Age and the salary of the people in the given dataset.
I've created an R code which analyses how the values of the training error and the validation error change as the value 
of K is increased from 1 to 50.
This repo contains the dataset named - Social_Network_Ads.csv, the R code named - Assignment1.R and a PPT named - Assignment.pptx which is
a step by step guide on achieving the plot.
